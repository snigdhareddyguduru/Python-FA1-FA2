Python 
Formative Assessments 

We had to create this particular app(Watterbuddy), which tracks your daily water goals based on your age, while giving you suggestions and daily summaries.

FA1 — Research and Design

For FA1, I worked on the planning and design part of my app called WaterBuddy. I started by researching different water tracking apps to understand what kind of features people usually like. I learned that simple visuals, reminders, and personalized options make these apps more useful.

I used Canva to create the storyboard for my app. I designed how each screen would look, including a mascot named “Wacker,” who represents the user’s water buddy. I focused on showing how the app tracks water intake, sends reminders, and allows users to set goals. I didn’t write any code during this phase — my main goal was to figure out how everything should work and look.

FA2 — Coding and Implementation

For FA2, I started developing the actual app using Python. This was the first time I properly wrote and understood code, so I took help from generative AI, my teacher, a friend, and a few YouTube videos to guide me through each step. I learned everything from what a terminal is to how Streamlit can be used to build and run apps with an interface.

At first, I found it confusing, but after some time, I began to understand how coding works — like how inputs, logic, and outputs connect. I wrote the code with small changes from my original FA1 plan to make it run smoothly. The code tracks the user’s water intake, calculates goals based on their age, and reminds them to stay hydrated.

Even though I had help, I made sure to understand every single line of the code, and I was able to explain how it all works.

Code Explanation

The code starts by asking for the user’s name and age, then calculates how much water they should drink daily. It takes user input for how many glasses they’ve had and compares it with their goal. If they haven’t met it, it tells them how much more water they need.

I used Streamlit to make the app interface so users can easily interact with it instead of just using the terminal. The program uses simple Python functions, conditional statements, and variables to perform calculations and display results.

Reflection

This project taught me how to think through a problem and build a complete app from scratch. In FA1, I learned how to plan and design, while in FA2, I learned how to actually code and make things work.

Even though I was completely new to coding, I now understand how programs are structured and how tools like Streamlit make them interactive. This project made me realize how much you can create when you’re willing to learn and experiment.
